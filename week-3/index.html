                <p>LANGLEY, VA - A report released Tuesday by the CIA's office of Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscurred hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters. </p>
                <p>
                According to the report, sections of the documents -"almost invariably the most crucial passages" -are marred by an indelible black line that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.

                CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will never know the particulars of several historical events, such as; 
                 <ul>
