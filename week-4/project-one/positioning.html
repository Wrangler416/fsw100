            <h2>How to conserve water on a daily basis</h2>
            <h3>July 22nd 2020</h3>
            <p>
            If you have a foot pump, turn off your pressure water except for times when you’re filling a large container.  With pressure water, you waste some every time you turn the water on and off.  And since most foot pumps put out a smaller volume, you don’t use as much when it is “running.”  This is particularly effective for hand washing and tooth brushing.  half-gallon tank sprayer is perfect for all sorts of on-deck chores where we needed fresh water.  We found the pump style much easier to use than the hand-squeeze type.  We also preferred the type with an integrated nozzle rather than a hose and wand, making one-handed operation easy.  We used our sprayer for a variety of chores from washing snorkel gear to wiping salt spray off the windshield and sail bag zippers, as well as cleaning stainless.  We also used it many times when we didn’t want to take a full shower but wanted to quickly rinse the salt water off ourselves – or our dog Paz.

            <h2>How to dead wreckon your vessel</h2>
            <h3>June 18th 2020</h3>
        <p> Dead reckoning begins with a known position, or fix, which is then advanced, mathematically or directly on the chart, by means of recorded heading, speed, and time. Speed can be determined by many methods. Before modern instrumentation, it was determined aboard ship using a chip log. More modern methods include pit log referencing engine speed (e.g. in rpm) against a table of total displacement (for ships) or referencing one's indicated airspeed fed by the pressure from a pitot tube. This measurement is converted to an equivalent airspeed based upon known atmospheric conditions and measured errors in the indicated airspeed system. A naval vessel uses a device called a pit sword (rodmeter), which uses two sensors on a metal rod to measure the electromagnetic variance caused by the ship moving through water. This change is then converted to ship's speed. Distance is determined by multiplying the speed and the time. This initial position can then be adjusted resulting in an estimated position by taking into account the current (known as set and drift in marine navigation). If there is no positional information available, a new dead reckoning plot may start from an estimated position. In this case subsequent dead reckoning positions will have taken into account estimated set and drift.

            <h2>Using solar to power your boat</h2>
            <h3>May 14th 2020</h3>
            <p>Almost every aspect of this sector has seen enormous development over the past decade, with worldwide installed capacity having grown by 3,000 per cent since 2005. The resulting economies of scale mean prices have tumbled, while funds are continuing to pour into research and development. Panels are becoming progressively more efficient, with the best commercially available units now having an efficiency of around 25 per cent, although double that has been achieved in laboratory conditions.  At the moment the thin film panels mentioned above are around 12-14 per cent efficient, but in the future we can expect all types of solar panel to become smaller in area for a given output.  In addition, today’s panels are less susceptible to output drops when in partial shade and give good performance in cloudy conditions. This makes mounting panels on the coachroof, rather than a cumbersome gantry, an increasingly viable option. Currently solar sells for a very wide range of prices, with most marine grade panels priced from around £200 to well over £500 per 100 watts.
